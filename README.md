# Dojo-Django-todo-
I have taken python as en extra elective this sem, and had to do a project 
so i made this todo app with DJango MVC framework
i followed a tutorial on youtube to amek this project and learned a lot from that, 
hopefully i wont be coming back to django anytime soon. (cause im a NODE enthusiast ðŸ˜† )
